# Refresh ad slots

You can use the refresh functionality of the Google Publisher Tag (GPT) library
to dynamically reload ads without having to refresh the entire contents of your
page.

Important: To comply with Google policy and enable your inventory to compete on
Ad Exchange, you must
[declare which portions of your inventory refresh][ads_hc_refresh].

In order to implement this functionality, you'll need to generate a GPT tag and
apply some modifications. This sample implementation features two ad slots and
corresponding buttons to refresh the slots with new ads.
